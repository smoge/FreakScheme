Yeahp, that's our Scheme! Now its time for yours!


#### What We Have Done
In broad terms, we've built a programming language that's dynamically typed, runtime evaluated, and largely based on Scheme.
We've extensively relied on Haskell abstractions: functors, monads, and their transformers and derivatives.
Although we do handle input/output, our language is pretty simple and lacks optimization.
However, we are in a very good position to quickly extend the language in in a couple of different ways.

#### Where To Go From Here
The Scheme we've created can be extended in the following ways:

* Paired List `LispVal` data constructor
* Type System
* Build out library to create a useful DSL
* Compile to DSL to a stack language, C, or LLVM
* Submit a PR and improve this project!

In many ways, I think of this project as the spiritual predecessor to Stephen Diehl's [**Write You A Haskell**](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/fun/). I think you're ready, but that's really up to you!
