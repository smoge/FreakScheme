# Notes

- Everything in Scheme is an object. 
- This is out Haskell type LispVal.
- These objects are stores in a single enviroment, EnvCtx, which is
required to resolve the value of a variable.
- The scope of a variable is limited by its lexical scope.
- Scheme is not Lazy, when functions are evaluated all of its
  arguments are evaluated before being passed into the function. 
- Dynamic Dispatch


- Main.hs --> parse command line options
- Repl.hs --> Read Evaluate Print Loop
- Parser.hs --> 
- Eval.hs
- LispVal.hs
- Prims.hs
- Pretty.hs
