# FreakScheme

A Scheme interpreter written in Haskell, sort of. Maybe it will become something else, who knows. 

Welcome to the whimsical world of FreakScheme, where the charm of Scheme meets the might of Haskell, all sparked by the original insights of Adam Wespiser. This isn't just another Scheme interpreter; it's a creative odyssey inspired by the legendary "Write You A Scheme, Version 2.0," penned by Wespiser himself on a crisp November day in 2016. Get ready to embark on a coding adventure where every parenthesis counts and the REPL is your trusty sidekick! )))))
