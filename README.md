# FreakScheme

A Scheme interpreter written in Haskell, sort of. Maybe it will become something else, who knows. 

Welcome to the whimsical world of FreakScheme, where the charm of Scheme meets the might of Haskell, all sparked by the original insights of Adam Wespiser. This isn't just another Scheme interpreter; it's a creative odyssey inspired by the legendary "Write You A Scheme, Version 2.0," penned by Wespiser himself on a crisp November day in 2016. Get ready to embark on a coding adventure where every parenthesis counts and the REPL is your trusty sidekick!

## ðŸŒŸ What Makes FreakScheme So Special?

- **A Nod to Adam Wespiser**: FreakScheme tips its hat to "Write You A Scheme, Version 2.0." It's our way of keeping the spirit of Wespiser's masterpiece alive and kicking.
- **Scheme Through Haskell's Lens**: Imagine wielding Haskell's functional programming prowess to bring Scheme scripts to life. It's like mixing potions in a wizard's cauldron to brew something truly magical.
- **A Treasure Trove of Docs**: Our documentation is like a map to buried treasure, guiding you through the mysteries of parsing, evaluating, and casting code spells.
- **The REPL: Your Magic Mirror**: Whisper your code into the REPL and watch as it reflects back insights, answers, and sometimes, even more questions.
