# FreakScheme

A Scheme interpreter written in Haskell, sort of. Maybe it will become something
else, who knows. 

Welcome to FreakScheme, where the charm of Scheme meets the power of Haskell,
following the original insights of Adam Wespiser, and his legendary "Write You A
Scheme, Version 2.0," penned by Wespiser himself on a crisp November day in
2016. Get ready to embark on a coding freak show where every parenthesis counts
and the REPL is your trusty sidekick.
